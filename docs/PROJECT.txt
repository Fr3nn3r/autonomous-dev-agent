I want a fully featured AI chatbot with python backend and react front-end (shadcn). 
The user must be able to configure any of the availablee models
The App must support only openAI
All regular playground parameters must be supported,
documents, reasoning, deep research, PRO mode, image generation, websearch, tools, all must be supported assuming it is supported by the python API
All conversations must be stored for future use and retrieval
the app must display live the number of token sent and recieved by the app to provide a sense of connectiveness to the user
the app must support multiple themes and light/dark modes
the app mus be able to list out all the models available dynamically (if available through API) or maintain an updated list of features
the backend must use filebased storage but the storage layer must use an abstraction so that a DB persisitence implementation can be created later.
the developement must take particular care to make the app design look and feel premium and professional.
there must be a search for data from previous conversations
the developers must try to deliver above and beyond the product's owners expectations by adding features that are likely required but not necessarily requiested.
Apply these guidelines to implement UI themeing: C:\Users\fbrun\Documents\GitHub\autonomous-dev-agent\docs\theming-standalone.md
